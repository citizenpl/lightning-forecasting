# lightning-forecasting
This project is about high-resolution thunderstorm forecasting in an attempt to predict the occurrence and intensity of thunderstorms in the hyper-local level. The study focuses on the most identifiable feature of a thunderstorm, which is the lightning activity. It models the lightning activity both from a classification and a regression perspective, by using reanalysis meteorological data as input to a bunch of machine learning models, including decision trees and support vector machines. As witnessed throughout the study, novel approaches that lead to state-of-the-art performance in prediction of both the presence and intensity of lightning events in local areas are introduced and analyzed.
